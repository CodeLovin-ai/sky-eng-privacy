  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Sky ENG does not collect or store any personal information — we don’t even ask for your name or email. All chats and transcripts stay safely on your device. The AI runs locally, with internet access only needed for certain live speech features and for 2x ads.</p>
  
  <p>Advertising partners may use their own tools (such as identifiers or cookies) to personalize ads, measure performance, and improve relevance. This is standard practice for ad-supported apps. No personal information is sold.</p>

  <p>Apple’s App Tracking Transparency prompt may appear, allowing you to opt out of ad tracking at any time via your device settings.</p>

  <h2>Support</h2>
  <p>If you need technical support, you can contact us at: <a href="mailto:codelovin@outlook.com">codelovin@outlook.com</a></p>
